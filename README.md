When I was searching for some illustration for inspiration I came across these cute Indian god Illustration (I am really sorry for the creator, as I am not quoting their work. If someone knows who is the artist please do let me know). So I designed this website keeping the Illustration as an inspiration, and to tried to implement some simple animation and transition.

Couple things to notice üëÅ:

1. All the god has a large illustration that is swinging at the right corner.
2. The background color changes to a random color selected from god's illustration color pallet when ever a god is selected.
3. Used a Indian typography
