the Hindu pantheon, is really a divine cosmic energy that represents feminine energy and the dynamic forces that move through the universe. Shakti, who is responsible for creation and can also be an agent of change, is often manifested to destroy demonic forces and restore balance.\r\n        As a vital cosmic force, Shakti takes many forms and names, including mother goddess, fierce warrior, and the dark goddess of destruction. In Hinduism, every god has a Shakti, or energy force. It’s one of the reasons she is worshipped by millions of people throughout India.`,\r\n        godImage: shakti\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        godId: \"003\",\r\n        godName: 'Brahma',\r\n        godDescription: `Brahma is frequently identified with the Vedic god Prajapati.During the post-Vedic period, Brahma was a prominent deity and his cult existed; however, by the 7th century, he was frequently attacked and lost his significance. He was also overshadowed by other major deities like Vishnu, Shiva and Devi. Along with other such Hindu deities, Brahma is sometimes viewed as a form (saguna) of the otherwise formless (nirguna) brahman, the ultimate metaphysical reality in Vedantic Hinduism.`,\r\n        godImage: brahma\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        godId: \"004\",\r\n        godName: 'Vishnu',\r\n        godDescription: `Lord Maha Vishnu is the Supreme Godhead of Vaishnavism (Para Brahman or Nirguna Brahman) in puranas . He is called Swambhagwan in the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Vishnu is one of the three main gods in Hinduism and the Absolute Supreme being in the Vaishnava tradition. Vishnu is one of the members in the trimurti in Hinduism.[5] Vishnu is the preserver god, which means he protects the universe from being destroyed and keeps it going. According to this religion, he has come to earth in nine forms (called avatars) so far, with one yet to come at the end of Kali Yuga to destroy evil. His most famous incarnations are Rama, Krishna, Parashurama And Narasimha. Vishnu's wife is Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune. Lord Vishnu is usually shown with light blue skin and four arms. The Lord holds a lotus (Padma), the Indestructible Mace Of Lord Vishnu (Kaumodaki), a conch (Shankha) and the Unstoppable Disc Of Lord Vishnu (Sudarshana Chakra) in each of his four hands. He is known to take many guises, but the three main forms of Vishnu are Mahavishnu Karanodakshayi Vishnu (Mahavishnu), Garbhodaksayi Vishnu and Kshirodakashayi Vishnu. The latter two are the expansion of Karanodakshayi Vishnu.`,\r\n        godImage: vishnu\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        godId: \"005\",\r\n        godName: 'Shiva',\r\n        godDescription: `Shiva is the third god in the Hindu triumvirate.

The other two gods are Brahma and Vishnu.\r\n\r\n        Brahma is the creator of the universe while Vishnu is the preserver of it. Shiva's role is to destroy the universe in order to re-create it.\r\n        \r\n        Hindus believe his powers of destruction and recreation are used even now to destroy the illusions and imperfections of this world, paving the way for beneficial change. According to Hindu belief, this destruction is not arbitrary, but constructive. Shiva is therefore seen as the source of both good and evil and is regarded as the one who combines many contradictory elements.`, godImage: shiva\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        godId: \"006\",\r\n        godName: 'Shani',\r\n        godDescription: `Shani Bhagwan (also known as Sani, Shani Dev, Sani Maharaj, and Chayyaputra) is one of the most popular deities in the traditional religion of Hinduism. Shani is the harbinger of bad luck and retribution, and practicing Hindus pray to Shani to ward off evil and remove personal obstacles. The name Shani comes from the root Sanaischara, meaning slow mover (in Sanskrit, \"Shani\" means \"the planet Saturn\" and \"chara\" means \"movement\"); and Shanivara is the Hindu name for Saturday, which is dedicated to Shani Baghwan.`,\r\n        godImage: shani\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        godId: \"007\",\r\n        godName: 'Yama',\r\n        godDescription: `Yama is the Hindu god of death, king of ancestors, and final judge on the destination of souls.
