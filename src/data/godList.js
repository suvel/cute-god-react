His most famous incarnations are Rama, Krishna, Parashurama And Narasimha. Vishnu's wife is Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune. Lord Vishnu is usually shown with light blue skin and four arms. The Lord holds a lotus (Padma), the Indestructible Mace Of Lord Vishnu (Kaumodaki), a conch (Shankha) and the Unstoppable Disc Of Lord Vishnu (Sudarshana Chakra) in each of his four hands. He is known to take many guises, but the three main forms of Vishnu are Mahavishnu Karanodakshayi Vishnu (Mahavishnu), Garbhodaksayi Vishnu and Kshirodakashayi Vishnu.
